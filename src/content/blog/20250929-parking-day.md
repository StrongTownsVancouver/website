Last weekend, cities around the world took part in Park(ing) Day, an event in which community members pay for a parking stall, but instead of storing a car there, they set up a parklet or pop-up art project. The premise is simple: we use a lot of valuable urban land to store private vehicles. What else could we do with that space that would bring more value to the community?

<br>

On Sunday, VanPOP (Vancouverites for People-Oriented Places) set up a patio parklet in a parking spot on Commercial Drive near E5th Ave, located in front of several small businesses (local restaurants). With just a tent and a few folding chairs, the parklet drew some attention, but for most passers-by, it fit seamlessly into the neighbourhood.

<br>

We had chosen this spot for a reason: the local restaurants on this block have limited patio space and there is no free community space to gather. With an ice cream shop, a café, and a pizza place offering take-out meals, customers are often left to stand in the street with their food or walk a few blocks to the closest park.

<br>

We had a few VanPOP regulars hanging out in the space, but our hope was that these customers would take a moment to stop, take a seat, and join us for a little chat.

<br>

Over the course of a few hours, we heard from several community members who took us up on the offer. We invited some to sit with us, and others pulled up a chair of their own accord without realizing this wasn’t an official patio space (just what we wanted!). We also got to learn about some of their local challenges and hear multiple perspectives on the issues we care about.

<br>

VanPOP advocates for stronger communities by supporting denser, affordable housing; safe, complete streets; and more varied transportation options. All of this can support local businesses — public transit, more housing within walking distance, and direct cycling access are a better way to connect people to commercial areas than an abundance of parking and roads. There is no cycling infrastructure on Commercial Drive at the moment, but we still saw many cyclists passing by and stopping at the shops in front of our parklet (and parking their bikes with us!).

<br>

Even for avid cyclists, there can be challenges. For example, we spoke to a father of young kids who has been cycling as his main mode of transport for over a decade. He only realized just how dangerous urban cycling can be after he started taking his kids on a bike with him. With that “precious cargo” on the back, he has to be extra alert at every intersection. It hasn’t stopped him from biking, but he wishes there were a bike lane on the street — and we do too!

<br>

However, we also heard some pushback. One local resident questioned the need for a bike lane on Commercial Drive, when there’s already a bike lane on Nanaimo Street and a shared street on Woodland Drive, both a few blocks away. We countered that the point of a bike lane is to provide access to places people want to go; while a bike lane on Nanaimo Street is a useful thoroughfare, it doesn’t support shops on Commercial Drive.

<br>

By discussing our different perspectives, we were able to have a productive conversation. Did we fully agree in the end? Maybe not, but perhaps we’ll both think about the other’s point of view the next time changes are proposed on this street.

<br>

We also heard from residents with strong opinions on transit, cost of living, housing, public spaces, and more. All of these topics are connected. The design of our cities determines how we get to live our lives, so these are problems that touch all of us. Every budget, every policy, every project is a choice that impacts our well-being and the options available to us.

<br>

Our hope with Park(ing) Day was to bring more people together and have a conversation about these issues: What kind of a city do you want to live in? How can we best advocate for your needs when decisions are being made? How can you advocate for yourself?

<br>

This is just one event, but VanPOP brings people together in a local conversation once a month. We invite you to join us, tell us what you care about, and help us spread the word!
