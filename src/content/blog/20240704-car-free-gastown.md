Strong Towns Vancouver recently organized a walking tour of the Water Street Pedestrian Zone Pilot, providing a unique chance to explore this transformative initiative. The event offered insights into the context and potential impacts of this project on a significant part of the city. The tour started at the Waterfront SkyTrain Station, a prominent transportation hub in Vancouver. The tour of Gastown officially began after a short 100-meter distance from the station to the beginning of the Gastown Pedestrian Zone at Water Street and Cordova Street. This area was recently closed off to motor vehicles as part of a pilot project running from July to August this year. There's potential for the project to be repeated in the summer of 2025, which could inform decisions on a seasonal or permanent car-free Gastown.

## The Human Experience

The walking tour was a truly unique experience, offering us the chance to witness the significant changes brought about by the absence of cars. The atmosphere was serene, and the area was more breathtaking, marked by cleaner air and quieter streets. This allowed us to appreciate the historic neighbourhood in a new light, a view that had yet to be possible for decades due to car-centric planning. We observed people calmly exploring the neighbourhood and enjoying the street where cars used to dominate. Bikes, mobility scooters, and pedestrians could navigate the car-free sections of the street safely, unhindered by empty parked vehicles or narrow sidewalks. This shift in the use of public space created a vibrant, accessible environment for everyone.

## Impact on Local Businesses

The pedestrian zone initiative can have a significant impact on local businesses, from how they receive deliveries to how customers locate storefronts when driving to Gastown. While some hiccups are typical during the early stages of a pilot project like this, once the necessary kinks have been sorted out, businesses typically enjoy improved foot traffic. With the newly pedestrian-friendly design, people naturally slow down, appreciate their surroundings, and discover local businesses they might have otherwise overlooked. The absence of cars leads to increased foot traffic, providing businesses with greater visibility and opportunities for customer engagement. The exploration of local businesses by both tourists and residents increases, contributing positively to the local economy.

The placemaking that happens when creating these walkable, car-free commercial zones results in increased dwell time. People will not only come here to have dinner and drinks or to explore a few shops, but they may actually spend a longer chunk of their day here. The Gastown Pedestrian Zone joins many other pedestrian-focused commercial districts in the region and around the world that act as a catalyst for small businesses to grow and thrive.

The experience of pedestrian zones bring to life a vibrant, community-focused atmosphere that encourages exploration and supports local businesses. Seeing this pilot first-hand was an affirmation of the value of such initiatives and a hopeful glimpse into the future of planning in Vancouver. We look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this pilot project unfold, and we are excited to see more pedestrian-focused commercial spaces in the city.

## Acknowledging History and the Changes Made

As one of the oldest parts of the city, Gastown holds substantial historical significance, evident in its charming cobblestone streets and Victorian architecture. A notable point of discussion was the former statue of Gassy Jack, the man Gastown was named after. The statue was dismantled by activists in 2022 during an annual Women's Memorial March, drawing attention to the countless missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit. This point of the tour, led by Strong Towns Vancouver member and organizer Ana Ivkov, prompted the need to acknowledge the colonial history of the founding of this city as we know it today, reminding us of our role as settlers on unceded, ancestral, and traditional territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations.

The pedestrian zone of Gastown is adorned with historic features and enhancements that enrich the visitor's experience. The charm of the area is accentuated by historic lampposts lined along the street, not only adding to the aesthetic appeal but also serving a functional purpose in maintaining Gastown's historic character. The outdoor seating areas, a direct benefit of the pedestrian zone, provide spots for rest and social interaction. Visitors are also drawn to the famous Gastown Steam Clock, a landmark built in 1977 that has since become an emblem of the area. The neighbourhood is further embellished with various art installations, many created by local artists, adding a unique touch to the streetscape and enriching the pedestrian experience.

## How Gastown Comes Together

It was inspiring to witness how a car-free zone can invigorate a historic neighbourhood, enhancing its charm while improving accessibility and livability. This initiative represents a significant step towards creating more inclusive, vibrant urban spaces. We hope to see more business improvement associations, along with the Gastown Business Improvement Society, advocate for more pedestrian-first commercial areas in the city. The support and involvement of the community are crucial in making these pedestrian zones a reality. These zones not only improve the quality of urban life but also stimulate local businesses. We heartily recommend that both locals and tourists explore and appreciate the pedestrian-friendly Gastown and support the vast array of shops and restaurants, many of which are locally owned and operated.

After spending a delightful afternoon touring the pedestrian zone, some of our group decided to extend the camaraderie a little longer over a cup of coffee or tea. We tried to find a local café that could accommodate our group of twelve. Still, surprisingly, even on a Tuesday evening, most were bustling with customers, a testament to the thriving local business scene. However, we were fortunate to be welcomed at the newly opened Sonder Café at 321 Water St. Our group chatted about other pedestrian-focused commercial street experiences, including Government Street in Victoria, BC, Pike Place Market in Seattle, WA, and Byward Market in Ottawa, ON. This experience underscored the need for additional outdoor seating in the pedestrian zone, a matter which the city has since addressed.

The removal of cars has allowed this neighbourhood's historic charm to shine, creating a captivating experience for both locals and visitors. This pedestrian zone is an excellent example of how urban spaces can be transformed to enhance community engagement and local businesses.
