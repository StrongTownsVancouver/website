                                Strong Towns is a global movement that has set
                                its sights on transforming the way we envision
                                and build our communities. The movement is
                                rooted in a deep-seated passion for urban
                                development and public policy, with a mission to
                                foster sustainability, resilience, and vibrancy
                                in communities across the globe. We exist to
                                challenge conventional thinking, pushing
                                boundaries and provoking fresh perspectives on
                                urban development. Our goal is not just to
                                inspire a new generation of urbanists, but to
                                empower them to take action and drive change in
                                their own communities.

                                Established in late 2023, Strong Towns Vancouver
                                is a piece of this dynamic global movement. We
                                are more than just a local chapter â€“ we are a
                                local conversation! A collective of individuals
                                from all sorts of personal and professional
                                backgrounds dedicated to fostering a stronger
                                and more resilient Vancouver. Our focus is on
                                promoting models of development that will
                                sustain and strengthen our city in the long
                                term.

                                We understand that building a stronger city goes
                                beyond the physical infrastructure. It means
                                cultivating a culture of thought-provoking
                                conversations and engaging events that bring
                                people together. It means providing valuable
                                resources to help our community understand and
                                implement our mission. But most importantly, it
                                means driving action, no matter how small.
